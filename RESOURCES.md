assignments. Solutions listed below are specifically tailored for 
students as all of them provide private repositories free of charge. 

### Self hosted solutions

your local machine.

### Third party solutions

#### GitHub Education

GitHub is now offering unlimited private repositories for student or
university teaching staff. University email is required for verification 
and the process could take up to 2 weeks. (In practice, after clicking

promoted to student account).

In addition to unlimited private repositories, student will also 
receive a list of bundled services to use with GitHub
such as free Travis CI for private repositories. Note that GitHub 
organisations are not supported for education/free accounts which 
might be important for group work.
